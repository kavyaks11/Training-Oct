                    <h2>Humans...</h2>
                    <p>Humans are the most abundant and widespread species
                        of primate, characterized by bipedalism and large
                        complex brains.this has enabled the development of
                        advanced tools , culture, language.

                    <h2>Human intelligence</h2>
                    <p>Human intelligence is a mental quality that consists
                        of the abilities to learn from experince, adapt  to
                        new situations understand and handle abstract concepts
                        and use knowledge to manipulate one's environment.

                    <h2>Investigations</h2>
                    <p>Much of the excitment amon investigators in the field of
                        intelligence derives from their attempts to determine 
                        exactly what intelligence is.different investigators 
                        have emphasised different aspects of intelligents in
                        their definitions.

                    <h2>Definitions</h2>
                    <p>For example, in a 1921 symposium the American psycologists
                        Lewis Terman and Edward L.Thorndike differed over the definition
                         of intelligence, Terman stressing the ability to think abstractly
                         and thorndike emphasising learning and the ability to give good response 
                         to questions.

                    <p>
                        Theories of intelligence , as is the case with most
                        scientific theories, have evolved through a succession 
                        of models.For the most influential paradigms have been
                        psycological measurement;cognitive psycology which concerns 
                        itself with the process by wich the mind functions;cognitivism
                        and contexualism, a combined approach that studies the interaction between
                        the environment and mental processes.

                    <h2>psycometric theories</h2>
                    <p>
                        psycometric theories have generally sought
                        to understand the structure of intelligence.
                        what from does it take and what are its part,if any?
                        such theories haave generally been based on and
                        established by data obtained from tests of mental
                        abilities.
